## Key Business Insights

### Funnel Performance
- Over 50% of sessions drop before reaching product pages, making top-of-funnel discovery the largest opportunity.
- Once users engage with products, add-to-cart behavior is strong (~51%).

### Conversion Interpretation
- Purchase conversion appears high because purchases are measured at the customer level and attributed across sessions.
- This is an analytical approximation, not a production checkout metric.

### Device Behavior
- Drop-off and engagement metrics are similar across devices.
- Mobile shows marginally higher drop-off, suggesting possible checkout or UX friction, though differences are small.

### Product & Revenue Insights
- Revenue concentration shows that pricing and conversion quality matter more than raw traffic volume.
- High-revenue products are not always the most viewed.

### Customer Segments
- Loyal customers show fewer interactions before purchase, indicating faster decision-making.
